# Crypto_Stocks_Clustering

In this analysis, the unsupervised machine learning technique is used to group a list of crypto currencies provided in a “crypto_market_data.csv” file.

The CSV file contains price change data of cryptocurrencies over different periods.

The steps for this analysis are broken out into the following sections:

* Import the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Prepare the Data (provided in the starter code)
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the Original Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for `k` Using the PCA Data
* Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
* Visualize and Compare the Results
